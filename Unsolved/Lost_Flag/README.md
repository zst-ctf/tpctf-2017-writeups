# Lost Flag
Crypto - 75 points

## Challenge 
> kmh12 was scared of hekkermen stealing his flags, so he encrypted them. Unfortunately, he was struck with malware and all his files were encrypted. Luckily, he backed up his encrypted flag, 45531566522752268234207465413786679228772310050424518387695752654841326765465, but he was unable to recover any of his files. Can you help him?

Note: The one time pad uses xor.

UPDATED with new files, should now be solvable.
